## Infrastructure 💾

Lemmy.World is looking for new engineers to help with our growing community.

Volunteers will assist our existing systems team with monitoring, maintenance and automation tasks. They will report to our head of infrastructure.

We’re ideally looking for chill folks that want to give back to their community and work on our back-end infrastructure.

Must have 4+ years of professional experience working in systems administration. We are not looking for junior admins at this time. Please keep in mind that, while this is a volunteer gig, we would ask you to be able to commit to at least 5-10 hours a week. We also understand this is a hobby and that family and work comes first.

Applicants must be okay with providing their CV and/or LinkedIn profile AND sitting for a video interview. This is due to the sensitivity of the infrastructure you will have access to.

We are an international team that works from both North America EST time (-4) and Europe CEST (+2) so we would ask that candidates be flexible with their availability.

If you are in AEST (+10) or JST (+9) please let us know, as we are looking for at least one Sysadmin to help out during our overnight.

You will be asked to participate in an on-call pool. Please keep in mind that this is a round-robin style pool, so it's alright if you're busy as it will just move along the chain.

## Software Development 🖥

Lemmy.World is looking for developers to help with our growing platform and infrastructure.

Volunteers will collaborate with other developers on our staff to both create new tooling / features and help improve existing ones.

We’re ideally looking for chill folks that want to give back to their community and work on both Lemmy Software itself (to contribute PRs to push back to LemmyNet) and to help with our own internal tooling.

Must have 2+ years of experience working in software development.

Junior developers, feel free to apply 😄

While we are mainly a Python team, if you are familiar with Rust, that would be a great plus!

Please keep in mind that, while this is a volunteer gig, we would ask you to be able to commit to at least 5-10 hours a week. We also understand this is a hobby and that family and work comes first.

Applicants must be okay with providing their CV AND sitting for a video interview.

We are an international team that works from both North America EST time (-4) and Europe CEST (+2) so we can be flexible with availability and async work!
